Chemfiles is a multi-language library written in modern C++ for reading and writing
from and to molecular trajectory files. These files are created by your favorite
theoretical chemistry program, and contains informations about atomic or residues
names and positions. Some format also have additional informations, such as
velocities, forces, energy, â€¦

The main targeted audience of chemfiles (`libchemfiles`) is chemistry researcher
working on their own code to do some kind of awesome science, without wanting to
bother about handling all the format that may exist in the world.

Running simulation (either Quantum Dynamic, Monte Carlo, Molecular Dynamic, or
any other method) often produce enormous amounts of data, which had to be
post-processed in order to extract informations. This post-processing step involve
reading and parsing the data, and computing physical values with the help of
statistical thermodynamic. Chemfiles tries to help you on the first point, by providing
the same interface to all the trajectory formats. If you ever need to change your
output format, your analysis tools will still work the same way. Chemfiles is
efficient because it allow you to write and debug your code only once, and then
to re-use it as needed.

- [Rust interface](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles.rs)

## Goals

The chemfiles library tries to:

 - Be easy and simple to use. There are only five main classes, which are really
   easy to understand. No messy templates and uninformative functions names;
 - Be a multi-languages library, usable from whatever language you prefer. If your
   favorite language is not supported, chemfiles have a clean C interface so that you
   can add a binding;
 - Following the UNIX moto, do one thing, and do it well.
 - Be cross-platform, and usable from Linux, OS X and Windows;
 - Have high-quality code, using modern software building technics (unit testing, code
   coverage, git for code versioning, ...).

 Chemfiles also have non goals, or explicitly refused goals:

 - It will not contains any code for analysis. You can find implementation of some
   analysis algorithms and a ready-to-use command line program in the
   [chrp](https://github.com/chemfiles/chrp) repository.
 - It will not contain molecular dynamics, Monte-Carlo, energy minimization or quantum
   chemistry code. If you want such code with access to the chemfiles features, please see
   the [cymbalum](https://github.com/Luthaf/cymbalum) molecular simulation engine, by the
   same author.

## Features

 - Automatic recognition of file type based on filename extension;
 - Support for a number of atoms which is not constant;
 - Set custom `UnitCell` or `Topology` when reading/writing;
 - Bindings to the most used scientific languages:  Python, C, Fortran 95;
 - Work with binary formats, if the corresponding libraries are available.
 - Open-source and freely available under the Mozilla Public License;

## File formats

### Supported formats

| Format        | Read ? | Write ? |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- |
| XYZ           | yes    |  yes    |
| Amber NetCDF  | yes    |  yes    |

The following formats are supported through the VMD molfile plugins, and are read-only:

| Format        | Read ? | Write ? |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- |
| PDB           | yes    |  no     |
| Gromacs .gro  | yes    |  no     |
| Gromacs .xtc  | yes    |  no     |
| Gromacs .trj  | yes    |  no     |
| Gromacs .trr  | yes    |  no     |
| CHARMM DCD    | yes    |  no     |

### Planned formats

See the [issue list](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles/labels/New%20Format) for
planned formats. If you want a new format to be added to chemfiles, you can either
do it by yourself (it is easy !) and create a pull-request to incorporate your
changes, or create a new issue with a link to the format reference and some
example of well-formed files.

## Getting started

The whole installation is documented [here](http://chemfiles.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html), this page only
show the basic steps. Please refer to the link below in case of problem.

If you want to use chemfiles from one of the available bindings, please refer to the
corresponding repository:

- [Python interface](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles.py)
- [Fortran interface](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles.f03)
- [Julia interface](https://github.com/chemfiles/Chemharp.jl)
- [Rust interface](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles.rs)

### Getting the dependencies

Long story made short, just use the right commands for your system:

```bash
# On apt-get based distributions
apt-get update
apt-get install cmake libnetcdf-dev

# On yum based distributions
yum install epel-release # The EPEL repository have the netcdf lib
yum install cmake netcdf-devel netcdf-cxx-devel

# On OS X with Homebrew (brew.sh)
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install cmake netcdf
```

You will also need a recent C++ compiler: gcc 4.9, clang 3.5 and icpc 14 are
known to work.

### Getting the code, building, installing

Get the code from the [release](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles/releases) page,
and extract the archive. Then in a terminal, go to the folder where you put the
code (`~/chemfiles` is assumed here):
```bash
cd ~/chemfiles
```

Then, [`cmake`](http://cmake.org/) is used to build the code. So, create a folder
and go for the build:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Then, you can build install the library:
```bash
make
make install
```

For more informations about how to configure the build, please [read the doc](http://chemfiles.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html)!

### Usage

The documentation is hosted at [readthedocs](http://chemfiles.readthedocs.org), but here
are some examples of how the usage feels in c++ and in C:

```cpp
// C++ version
#include <iostream>
#include "chemfiles.hpp"

int main() {
    chemfiles::Trajectory trajectory("filename.xyz");
    chemfiles::Frame frame;

    trajectory >> frame;
    std::cout << "There are " << frame.natoms() << " atoms in the frame" << std::endl;
    auto positions = frame.positions();

    // Do awesome things with the positions here !
}
```

```c
// C version
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "chemfiles.h"

int main(){
    CHFL_TRAJECTORY * trajectory = chfl_trajectory_open("filename.xyz", "r");
    CHFL_FRAME * frame = chfl_frame(0);
    size_t natoms = 0;

    if (!traj) {
        printf("Error while opening file: %s", chfl_last_error());
    }

    if (!chfl_trajectory_read(trajectory, frame)){
        // handle error here
    }
    chfl_frame_atoms_count(frame, &natoms);
    printf("There are %d atoms in the frame", natoms);

    float (*positions)[3] = (float(*)[3])malloc(sizeof(float[natoms][3]));

    if (!chfl_frame_positions(frame, positions, natoms)){
        // handle error
    }

    // Do awesome things with the positions here !

    chfl_frame_free(frame);
    chfl_close(trajectory);
    free(positions);
}
```

## Contributing

## Compilers, architecture and OS support

Chemfiles have been tested on the following platforms, with the following compilers :

 - Linux (64 bit)
    * GCC: gcc/g++ 4.9.2
 - OS X (64 bit)
    * GCC: gcc/g++ 4.9.2
    * LLVM: clang/clang++ 3.5
    * Intel: icc/icpc 14
 - Windows (32 bit) (only the C++ and C interfaces have been tested)
